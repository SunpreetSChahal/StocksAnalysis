## Stock Analysis

The analysis I conducted regarded a dataframe containing the price movement of the following securities; The Nasdaq Compisite, Apple, Microsoft, Amzaon, Google and Facebook.
I compared the movement of the Nasdaq exchange in relation to 5 mega-cap companies; AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL and FB.

I aimed to find the answers to the following; 
- Provide answers to any anomalies that occured within the market, explaining the events behind each pullback/bullish rally, and to provide information on how each comapny and the Nasdaq were effected. 
- Describe the patterns between each security and the correlation of the market as a whole.
- Visualise each security to present the price movement since each IPO was released.
